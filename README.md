# (Work in Progress) Breast Cancer Polygenic Risk Score Calculator

## Overview

This project implements a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) system that aggregates the effects of multiple genetic variants (SNPs) identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to estimate breast cancer risk. The model combines genetic information with clinical factors like age and family history for comprehensive risk assessment.
